# Todo List Application

I am using this repository as a resume / portfolio example piece to show potential employers that I have a well rounded development skill set.

I chose to do a sample TODO list application from scratch, because it is sort of the "hello world" of a full fledge app. It requires all of the various components of an actual application.

The tools that I am using to write this app:

* Twitter Bootstrap
    * I use a custom theme that I designed
* RactiveJS
    * Front end JS
    * 2 way data-binding
* NodeJS (Express)
* HTML5 LocalStorage
